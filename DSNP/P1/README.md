## Installation
In addition to Anaconda distribution of Python 3.7, you also need to install [tensorflow](https://tensorflow.google.com/) and [keras](https://keras.io/). They can all be easily installed by pip.

## Project Motivation
This is the work for the "Introduction to Data Science" part of "Data Scientist Nanodegree Program". This project shows us how to using CRISP-DM process to solve real word problem. Here I have studied the simple investment strategy of b&b based on the Airbnb's dataset. My interesting here is to locate and compare several factors that correlated to price and break down the investment problem into the following three smaller questions:
1. When we invest in real estate, we always emphasize location, so how much do loctaion affect rental prices?  
2. We live in an era where it's very easy to get comments from other people, so how much do guest reviews affect rental prices?  
3. If I have money to invest in a home stay facility, should I focus on location choice or improve the service to get good reviews? 

## File Descriptions
There is only 1 notebook illustrating the whole process to answer the questions above. It is well structured and well commented. The correponding dataset is also contained.
### 5. Results and Deploy
The main result is that loaction is a bit more important than reviews. The detailed disscus and what decisions should be made based on the results are posted on the [web site](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/66800334).
